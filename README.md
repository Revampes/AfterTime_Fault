# ratallofyou

A small Minecraft mod for Minecraft 1.8.9 built against MinecraftForge. This repo contains the source and Gradle build used to create the mod JAR.

## Quick summary

- Minecraft: 1.8.9 (Forge build: `1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9`)
- Java: Java 8 (sourceCompatibility & targetCompatibility set to 1.8)
- Build system: Gradle with ForgeGradle
- Mod artifact: built JAR is named using `archivesBaseName` and `version` from `version.txt`

## What you'll find here

- `src/main/java` - Java source for the mod
- `src/main/resources` - resource files (including `mcmod.info` template)
- `build.gradle` - project build file (includes helpful tasks like `copyMod`, `bumpVersion`, and `generateVersionInfo`)
- `version.txt` - single-line mod version used by the build
- `build/generated/sources/version` - generated `VersionInfo.java` (created at build time)

## Build (Windows PowerShell)

This project targets Java 8. Ensure you have a JDK 8 installed and `JAVA_HOME` points to it. From the repository root (where `gradlew.bat` lives) run:

```powershell
# Clean and build the mod
.\gradlew.bat clean build

# The build is configured to run the `copyMod` task after a successful build
# (it copies the built JAR into your local Minecraft mods folder). If you prefer
# to only build the jar, run:
.\gradlew.bat assemble
```

Notes:

- `build.finalizedBy copyMod` is configured in `build.gradle`. The `copyMod` task copies the generated JAR (named like `ratallofyou-<version>.jar`) to `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods` by default.
- If you wish to change the destination, edit the `copyMod` task in `build.gradle`.

## Development tasks in the build

- `generateVersionInfo` — generates `VersionInfo.java` in `build/generated/sources/version` containing a `VERSION` constant from the Gradle `version` property.
- `bumpVersion` — a task that compiles and runs a small `VersionBumper` helper that can update `version.txt` based on commit messages (see `build.gradle` for details).

The build reads the version from `version.txt` (fallback `0.1` if missing).

## Mod configuration / resources

- `src/main/resources/mcmod.info` is processed during `processResources`; the build will replace `${version}` and `${mcversion}` placeholders with the current values from the project.

## Runtime / Compatibility

- This mod was built for Minecraft 1.8.9 and the ForgeGradle tooling used in this repo. The code and build scripts reflect that era of modding (mappings: `stable_20`).
- Make sure your Minecraft instance uses the matching Forge version when testing the mod.

## Troubleshooting

- Build failures often come from an incorrect Java version. Verify `java -version` and `javac -version` use Java 8.
- If Gradle/ForgeGradle can't download dependencies, check your network and Maven repository settings. The buildscript uses `http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven` and `https://maven.minecraftforge.net` in addition to Maven Central.
- If the `copyMod` task fails to copy the jar, check that the destination path exists and that your account has write permissions to `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods`.

## Contributing

- Open an issue on the repository for bugs or feature requests.
- For code contributions, fork and send pull requests. Keep changes focused and include a brief summary of why the change is needed.

Suggested quick workflow:

```powershell
# run tests or quick sanity builds (if you add tests later)
.\gradlew.bat clean build

# verify the generated mod is present in your Minecraft mods folder
```
